# Legacy Java UI Tests – Allure Demo

Legacy **Java UI automation** project wired to **Allure** for reporting.

This project was originally used to experiment with:

- Structuring UI tests in Java
- Generating HTML reports with Allure
- Publishing reports (e.g. via GitHub Pages)

> ⚠️ This codebase is kept mainly for **historical / demo purposes** and may not follow my current best practices.

---

## Tech stack

- Java (Maven project)
- JUnit / TestNG (depending on the configuration in `pom.xml`)
- [Allure Framework](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/) for reporting
- Built with **Maven** (`pom.xml`)

---

## Project structure

Key folders:

- `src/test/java/AllureReports` – UI test classes and examples
- `allure-results` – raw results generated by Allure
- `build/reports/tests` – test execution reports from the build
- `target` – compiled classes and build artifacts

These folders (`allure-results`, `build`, `target`) are **generated** and should not be committed in modern setups (see `.gitignore` section below).

---

## Running the tests

> ℹ️ You need **Java** and **Maven** installed and configured in your `PATH`.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yosuancrespo/test.git
   cd test```

2. **Run the tests with Maven**

   `mvn clean test`

3. **Generate Allure report**

   Assuming you have Allure CLI installed:

   `allure serve allure-results`

   This will open a local HTML report in your browser.

**Notes**

- This repository is intentionally left “as is” as a reference of an older setup.
- For new client projects I prefer TypeScript + Playwright/Cypress and modern reporting/CI pipelines.
